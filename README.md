# Course materials for ECON407 Winter 2019
In reality: you are **guinea pigs** for the new course (where here we will emphasize slightly more macro content)

* ECON323 "Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications"
* Testing out a new textbook "QuantEcon DataScience: Introduction to Economic Modeling and Data Science"

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful, but **not required**.

However, for those coming in with advanced Python skills, you can use this as an opportunity to learn Julia and/or R for the first parts of the course

## Computational Setup

You will not need to install any software on your local computer.  You can use the online Jupyter environment from Syzygy
To setup, go to [ECON407 Syzygy Setup](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON407_2019&app=lab)

In the next few weeks, we will give you an HTML and additional repository with a similarly easy setup

For students doing Julia self-study for the first part of the course, setup on the VSE syzygy [QuantEcon Julia Setup](https://vse.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-jl-notebooks&app=lab)
 * Note, this is on a different jupyterhub for now
 * There is a bug in the display of some images on jupyter lab.  You can look at the [Lecture HTML](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/) instead 
 * You already have Jupyter installed, so start with [Using Jupyter](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html#Using-Jupyter) rather than the desktop setup.
